# Terms Of Service Acceptance Manager

**Note**: This project is still under initial development,
and not ready yet. It's currently a frankenstein between Foundry and Ape.

A Solidity smart contract for making sure the smart contract caller
has accepted the latest terms of service.

## Use cases

- Record on-chain that users have accepted some sort of a disclaimer 
- Enforce users to accept disclaimers when they use with the smart contract
- User signs an [EIP-191 message](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) from their wallet
- Multisignature wallet and protocol friendly [EIP-1271](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/SignatureChecker.sol) is supported

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Foundry

## Workflow

### Deploying

Deploy [TermsOfService smart contract](./contracts/TermsOfService.sol) for your chain

- Each deployment has its own smart contract address
- Each chain needs its own deployment
- Each TermsOfService tracks the currently active terms of service text

### Updating terms of service

Creating terms of service

- Create a Markdown/plain text terms of service file
  - Must be dated
  - Must have a version number counter start from 1, then 2
  - Record SHA-256 bit hash of the text 
- Use update script to bump the new terms of service live

### Users to sign the terms of service

- The smart contract has `canProceed` function to check if a 
  particular address has signed the latest terms of service version
- The user signs a [template message](./terms_of_service/acceptance_message.py)
  with their wallet. Note that this message only refers to the actual 
  terms of service based on its version, hash, date and link,
- The address must have always signed the latest terms of service,
  and should be prompted to sign again if this is not the case
- The terms of service signing payload can be passed part 
  as another smart contract transaction, and **does not** need
  to be a separate transaction

On hashes: There are two hashes. One for the actual terms of service
file (never referred in the smart contracts) and one for the message
(template-based) that users need to sign with their wallet.

## Getting started

Install framework with Poetry:

```
poetry install
```

## Compiling

```shell
poetry shell
ape compile
```

## Running tests

```shell
poetry shell
# TODO: there is a bug in pytest/ape test that it does not find the tests
# unless you explicitly pass it the tests folder
ape test tests
```

## Deploying

Using Foundry.

Compile:

```shell
foundry up
forge build
```

Then:

```shell 
export DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY=
export JSON_RPC_POLYGON=
export POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=
forge create \
  --rpc-url $JSON_RPC_POLYGON \
  --private-key $DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --etherscan-api-key $POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY \
  --verify \
  src/TermsOfService.sol:TermsOfService
```

#### PolygonScan verification failures with Forge 

Save the address. Because Polygonscan is a hard mistress and tends to crash, verify manually:

```shell
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xbe1418df0bAd87577de1A41385F19c6e77312780
scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### Initialising

[The INITIAL_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE placeholder terms of service message](./terms_of_service/acceptance_message.py) is used.


Get the hash of the message:

```shell
ipython 
```

Then type `%cpaste` and copy-paste in:

```python
from terms_of_service.acceptance_message import INITIAL_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE, get_signing_hash
new_line_escaped_msg = INITIAL_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE.replace("\n", "\\n")
print("Paste to your shell:")
print("")
print(f"""export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE_HASH={get_signing_hash(INITIAL_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE).hex()}""")
print(f"""export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE="{new_line_escaped_msg}" """)
````

```shell
export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE_HASH=  # Copy from above output
export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE=  # Copy from above output
export TERMS_OF_SERVICE_VERSION=1
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xbe1418df0bAd87577de1A41385F19c6e77312780  # Set your deployed contract
```

Then set the initial version:

```shell
cast send \
  --private-key $DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $JSON_RPC_POLYGON \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "updateTermsOfService(uint16,bytes32,string)" \
  "$TERMS_OF_SERVICE_VERSION" \
  "$ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE_HASH" \
  "$ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE"
```

You can also run the above command using [scripts/set-terms-of-service.sh](./scripts/set-terms-of-service.sh).
The script will complain if you have some variables unset.

See here troubleshooting if [cast send fails](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/161808/foundtry-cast-code-32000-message-replacement-transaction-underpriced-data).

## Updating terms of service version

With `ipython`:

```python
from terms_of_service.acceptance_message import INITIAL_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE, get_signing_hash

NEW_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE="""Update: December 23th, 2023

In our ongoing commitment to adhere to legal regulations, we will restrict IP addresses located in certain jurisdictions from accessing our applicationâ€™s frontend user interface. These jurisdictions include: United States, United Kingdom, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Russia. Thank you for your understanding and ongoing support

Last Modified: December 23rd, 2023"""

new_line_escaped_msg = NEW_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE.replace("\n", "\\n")
print("Paste to your shell:")
print("")
print(f"""export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE_HASH={get_signing_hash(NEW_ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE).hex()}""")
print(f"""export ACCEPTANCE_MESSAGE="{new_line_escaped_msg}" """)
print(f"""export TERMS_OF_SERVICE_VERSION=2""")
```

Then run:

```shell
scripts/set-terms-of-service.sh
```

## Updating terms of service w/ frontend

- Configure environment vars `DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JSON_RPC_POLYGON`, `$CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- Get the latest Terms of Service version from the smart contract using PolygonScan:m https://polygonscan.com/address/0xbe1418df0bAd87577de1A41385F19c6e77312780#readContract
- Bump the version up by one
- Get the Microsoft Word document from a laywer (lawyers love Microsoft Word)
- Convert to Markdown using e.g. https://word2md.com/
- Checkout frontend repo
- Add the file as .txt file to `lib/assets/tos/` e.g.`lib/assets/tos/2024-03-20.txt`
- Set environment variables as in [update.py](./scripts/update.py)
- Run `python scripts/update.py` to change on-chain state and get a new hash
- Update `lib/assets/tos/tos-map.js`

## Deployment

A deployment can be found on Polygon [0xbe1418df0bAd87577de1A41385F19c6e77312780](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xbe1418df0bAd87577de1A41385F19c6e77312780).
